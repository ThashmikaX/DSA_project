## Introduction
In an increasingly interconnected and data-driven world, the importance of secure and efficient 
transaction processing cannot be overstated. Our project, the "Security-First Command-Line 
Transaction Portal" aims to develop a robust and secure command-line interface for financial 
transactions, focusing strongly on user authentication, data encryption, and authorization. This 
project will leverage advanced data structures and algorithms to provide a command-line interface 
for conducting transactions focusing on security, integrity, and performance.


## Key Features
* User registration and authentication.
* Transaction processing and management (transfers, payments, etc.).
* Account management (account creation, balance tracking).
* Robust security measures, including data encryption.
* Role-based access control and authorization.
* Comprehensive activity logging and audit trails.
* A user-friendly command-line interface.
